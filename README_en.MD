Language: [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md) | English \
This project is a fork (spiritual successor) of Shoka, aimed at improving performance and optimizing the modified experience. \
The reason for its creation is that Shoka has not been updated for two years, accumulating a large number of bugs and feature requests.

The community resource guide and plugin repository for shokaX are available at [awesome-shokaX](https://github.com/theme-shoka-x/awesome-shokaX)

## üí¨ Differences from Shoka
The original Shoka used a combination of JavaScript + Native + Nunjucks technologies. \
ShokaX, on the other hand, uses TypeScript + Vue 3 + Pug technologies and has changed many hard-to-access CDN links.
